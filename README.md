# Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/decentraland/renderer-bff/badge.svg?branch=coverage)](https://coveralls.io/github/decentraland/renderer-bff?branch=coverage)

The Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) service was developed as the primary entry point for any Decentraland client. It provides a client-dedicated API designed to adapt its interfaces based on client needs, allowing it to evolve independently without impacting the underlying protocol. Although the current protocol implementation includes the BFF API within the realm description ([ADR-110](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110)), it is not actively utilized.
